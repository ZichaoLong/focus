# Docs Index

This directory is the source of truth for repository architecture, runtime
boundaries, and feature contracts.

## Reading Rule

When code and docs disagree, treat that as a contract gap. Tighten the code,
the docs, or both.

### Bilingual Fact Source

- Active bilingual pairs under `contracts/`, `architecture/`, and `decisions/`
  use the Chinese document as the canonical source and the English document as
  its synchronized peer. If their semantics conflict, the canonical Chinese
  document governs and the English drift is a contract gap that must be fixed.
- Each active Chinese document must declare itself the Chinese canonical source
  and link its exact English peer. Each English document must declare itself a
  synchronized English peer and link its exact canonical Chinese document.
- A semantic change should update both documents in the same change.
  `check-docs.sh` verifies pairs, roles, and exact reciprocal links; it does not
  pretend to prove semantic equivalence between two natural-language texts.
  That boundary still requires review.

### Cross-Frontend Precedence

For a question involving Web, Feishu, `focus` / `fcodex`, or the local control
plane acting on one shared thread, read the active contracts in this order:

1. `contracts/root-operation-owner.md` defines the sole main-turn writer and
   immediate release rule for lease-bearing Feishu/exclusive actions, plus the
   effect-specific boundary for ordinary Web/`fcodex` realtime input/control.
2. `contracts/fcodex-operation-owner.md` and
   `contracts/subagent-observation-and-recovery.md` add, respectively, fcodex
   transport details and the upstream-owned child-lifecycle, parent-history
   Tasks, direct-child-write, and cold-resume boundaries.
3. A frontend-specific lifecycle, settings, group, or command contract governs
   its own effect. It must neither extend lease-bearing main-turn ownership
   without a separately justified observable invariant nor reinterpret an
   ordinary realtime contributor as a writer.

This keeps retained recovery, subscription, presentation, or transport state
from accidentally becoming a durable main-turn writer rule.

## Document Types

Active docs are now organized by role:

- `docs/contracts/`
  - normative feature and runtime behavior contracts
- `docs/architecture/`
  - current architecture, layering, module split, and implementation shape
- `docs/decisions/`
  - decision records and upstream-derived safety constraints that explain why a
    design boundary exists
- `docs/verification/`
  - manual test checklists and verification-oriented material
- `docs/archive/`
  - completed plans and historical rollout material; useful for context, but
    not part of the active runtime contract

Status guidance:

- treat `contracts/`, `architecture/`, and `decisions/` as active repository
  facts
- treat `verification/` as validation support, not product/runtime semantics
- treat `archive/` as historical context only
- treat local notes under `docs/_work/` as working material, not as repository
  facts

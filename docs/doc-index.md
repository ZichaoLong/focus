# Docs Index

This directory is the source of truth for repository architecture, runtime
boundaries, and feature contracts.

## Reading Rule

When code and docs disagree, treat that as a contract gap. Tighten the code,
the docs, or both.

## Document Types

Active docs are now organized by role:

- `docs/contracts/`
  - normative feature and runtime behavior contracts
- `docs/architecture/`
  - current architecture, layering, module split, and implementation shape
- `docs/decisions/`
  - decision records and upstream-derived safety constraints that explain why a
    design boundary exists
- `docs/verification/`
  - manual test checklists and verification-oriented material
- `docs/archive/`
  - completed plans and historical rollout material; useful for context, but
    not part of the active runtime contract

Status guidance:

- treat `contracts/`, `architecture/`, and `decisions/` as active repository
  facts
- treat `verification/` as validation support, not product/runtime semantics
- treat `archive/` as historical context only
- treat local notes under `docs/_work/` as working material, not as repository
  facts

# Feishu Command Matrix

Chinese original: `docs/contracts/feishu-command-matrix.zh-CN.md`

This file is the source-of-truth matrix for the Feishu command surface.

It answers four questions only:

- which slash commands are formally supported
- which commands are reachable from the `/help` workbench
- who may execute them in P2P and group chats
- which local surface is the closest counterpart

It does not redefine:

- binding / attach / detach / backend state semantics
- fact sources or effectivity boundaries of the remaining setting family
- the full group-chat contract for `assistant / mention-only / all`

## 1. Reading Rules

- “Reachable from `/help`” means reachable through workbench buttons, forms, or follow-up result cards.
- “Admin only” means the current bot's admin check must pass.
- “Anyone” only means no admin check in that scope; it does not mean all group members may mutate shared state.

## 2. Commands

### 2.1 Navigation, Start, Thread Settings, and Connection Status

| Command | Purpose | Reachable from `/help` | P2P | Group | Closest local counterpart |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## 3. Commands Intentionally Not on the Workbench Home

These remain alias, plain-text, or result-card entry points rather than fixed home-card buttons:

- `/h`
- `/pwd`
- `/cancel`

Additional notes:

- `/commands` is now reachable from `More`
- `/attach` is now reachable from `Connection Status`
- `/debug-contact` is now reachable from `More -> Advanced Actions`

## 4. Result-card Buttons

These are part of the formal Feishu user surface and must be maintained together with slash commands:

- execution card: `Cancel Execution`
- `/threads` list card: `Resume/Current`, `Archive`, `More`, `Collapse`
- `/goal` card: `Refresh`, `Pause` / `Resume`, `Clear`
- `/reset-backend` result cards: attach/detach follow-up buttons such as `Attach Current Thread`, `Attach Current Instance`, and `Keep Detached`
- shared `/model` / `/effort` card, plus `/permissions` / `/approval` / `/collab-mode` cards: turn-time runtime-setting toggle buttons
- approval / extra-input cards: their request-type-specific allow / deny / submit buttons

## 5. Boundary

- `feishu-codex` owns install, instance, and service lifecycle. It is not the Feishu chat command surface.
- `feishu-codexctl` owns local inspection and management of bindings, threads, and services. It is not a second frontend.
- `fcodex` is the local live-thread continuation entry point.

If any Feishu command is added, removed, renamed, or moved in `/help`, or if button entry points or permission boundaries change, this file must be updated with the code.

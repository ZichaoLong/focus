# Shared Backend and Resume Safety

  wrapper runtime model

## 1. Upstream Baseline

- Upstream project: [`openai/codex`](https://github.com/openai/codex.git)
- Current local validation baseline: `codex-cli 0.118.0`, resolved locally to
  upstream tag `rust-v0.118.0`
  (`b630ce9a4e754d35a1f33e4366ba638d18626142`) and checked on 2026-04-03
- If this document later needs specific upstream source references, prefer
  commit-pinned `openai/codex` permalinks against that baseline instead of
  developer-local checkout paths
- This document focuses on safety and `/resume` semantics. It intentionally does
  not restate most wrapper/runtime details; those belong in
  `fcodex-shared-backend-runtime`.

## 2. Problem Statement

Two frontends are safe only when they write the same thread through the same
app-server backend.

If they resume the same persisted thread through different app-server processes,
they can each materialize their own live in-memory thread and append
conflicting state later.

After multi-instance support, this rule must be read more explicitly:

- multiple instances may share `CODEX_HOME` and the persisted thread namespace
- but at any moment, one thread may have live runtime residency in only one
  instance backend
- bare `codex` running its own isolated backend is still fully outside that
  coordination path

This document defines the current safety model for:

- shared backend operation
- `/resume` for threads not loaded in the current backend
- Feishu multi-chat behavior for the same thread

## 3. Verified Constraints

### 3.1 Hard facts we can rely on

- Within one app-server process, resuming an already-loaded thread reuses the
  loaded thread and subscriber model rather than creating a second live copy.
- `thread/loaded/list`, `thread/list.status`, and `thread/read.status` only
  describe the current app-server process.
- `thread/read` is a stored-history read and does not create a live thread.
- `thread/resume` loads the thread into the current app-server as a live thread.

### 3.2 Facts we cannot rely on

- We cannot reliably detect whether another stock TUI process is currently
  writing the same thread.
- `source` and `service_name` are provenance hints, not live ownership or lock
  signals.
- We cannot force another stock TUI process to stop writing.
- We cannot auto-attach to a stock TUI embedded app-server with current public
  mechanisms.

## 4. Core Safety Rule

Use one rule everywhere:

- One thread should be written through one backend.

If the user wants Feishu and local TUI to operate on the same live thread
safely, both must connect to the same app-server backend.

In this repository, that now splits into two layers:

- **within one instance**: Feishu and `fcodex` may safely share that instance backend
- **across instances**: a machine-level `ThreadRuntimeLease` prevents one
  thread from being live-attached by two instance backends at the same time

## 5. Backend Safety Boundary

### 5.1 Shared backend within one instance

This is the recommended safe path.

Properties:

- Feishu and local TUI write through the same app-server backend
- the same loaded thread state is shared
- multiple local TUI windows can attach to that backend without creating
  cross-process divergence

How the current runtime and `fcodex` wrapper make that work is documented in
`docs/architecture/fcodex-shared-backend-runtime.md`.

### 5.2 Another `feishu-codex` instance backend

This is the new boundary introduced by multi-instance support.

Properties:

- multiple instances share the persisted thread namespace
- each instance has its own live backend
- live residency of one thread is coordinated by the machine-level
  `ThreadRuntimeLease`
- automatic transfer now first writes a short-lived machine-level transfer
  reservation for the target instance, then asks the owner instance to release
  Feishu runtime, and finally lets the target acquire the live runtime
- if the owner instance is idle and reports `detach_available`,
  automatic transfer is allowed
- if the owner instance is still executing or still has pending approval /
  input, the write attempt must reject clearly
- if the owner instance has no Feishu binding for that thread, or still has a
  local `fcodex` holder on that thread, the write attempt must also reject
  clearly instead of trying to force that runtime away

So this is neither "one shared backend" nor "two backends that may dual-write".
It is a coordinated path with a shared persisted namespace but strictly
single-owner live runtime.

### 5.3 Bare `codex` isolated backend

This is what happens when the user runs stock TUI outside the shared backend.

Properties:

- `feishu-codex` cannot know whether that local TUI is idle, closed, or about
  to write
- `feishu-codex` cannot safely assume exclusive ownership of such a thread
- local continuation of the same live thread should use `fcodex` and the same
  instance shared backend instead
- continuing to write the same thread through bare `codex` on another backend
  is outside the supported safe path

## 6. `/resume` Safety Model

### 6.1 Classification

After matching the target thread, classify it using only hard facts:

1. `loaded-in-current-backend`
2. `not-loaded-in-current-backend`

Do not add a third "probably safe" class based on cached ownership heuristics.

### 6.2 Loaded in current backend

If the target thread is already loaded in the current `feishu-codex` backend:

- resume directly
- bind the current Feishu chat to that thread
- do not show a risk card
- `resume` does not use this path to rewrite the live runtime's profile or
  provider

This is safe because the thread already lives in the same backend.
If the thread must later be re-resolved under a different profile, it must
first return to `not-loaded-in-current-backend`.

### 6.3 Not loaded in current backend

If the target thread is not loaded in the current backend, this repository's
safety decision is to call `thread/resume` directly.

Behavior:

- resume the target thread immediately
- bind the current Feishu chat to that thread
- if the user later attaches through `fcodex` on the same instance shared backend,
  Feishu and `fcodex` can continue operating on the same live thread safely
- if another instance backend currently holds live residency for that thread,
  actual resume still has to obey the machine-level `ThreadRuntimeLease`:
  - automatic transfer is allowed only when the owner can release immediately
  - busy / pending owner state must reject clearly
- if the thread already has a saved thread-wise profile, Feishu and `fcodex`
  both use that thread-wise resume config
- if the thread has no saved thread-wise profile, neither side adds an extra
  instance-level resume-profile fallback

This path assumes:

- local continuation of the same thread uses `fcodex`
- bare `codex` is not also writing that thread through another backend

One detail should be recorded explicitly: the two clients do not reach that
behavior through the same execution path.

- Feishu reads the thread-wise record and sends profile / model /
  model_provider before `thread/resume`
- `fcodex` reads the same thread-wise record in the wrapper layer and injects
  profile only when that record exists

That difference should not be interpreted as a semantic mismatch. The intended
semantics are the same on both sides: resume of an unloaded thread prefers
thread-wise config, and otherwise does not add an extra override.

The repository decision is to no longer block this path with a preview/confirm
card. Avoiding dual-backend writes for such threads is an operational rule, not
a UI-enforced guard.

Multi-instance mode no longer adds a separate thread-admission filter:

- all instances resolve persisted threads from the same shared namespace
- Feishu `/threads` and `feishu-codexctl thread list --scope cwd` are
  current-directory views over that namespace
- once a path actually wants live runtime residency, all of them still obey
  the same `ThreadRuntimeLease`

## 7. Provenance and Symmetric Risk

Expose provenance metadata as informational UI only:

- `source`
- `service_name` when available

Use cases:

- help users understand where a thread came from
- make shared vs external threads easier to reason about

Do not use provenance alone as an automatic safety decision.

The risk is symmetric:

- if Feishu resumes an external thread into its own backend, divergence is
  possible
- if a user later resumes a Feishu-active thread through bare `codex` on
  another backend, the same risk exists

`feishu-codex` cannot eliminate that risk. This repository chooses a more direct
`/resume` path, so the safety boundary relies on one operational rule: if
multiple clients should continue the same live thread, keep them on the shared
backend via `fcodex`, and do not mix in bare `codex`.

## 8. Feishu Multi-Chat Boundary

Safety and UX are different concerns.

### 8.1 Safety

All Feishu chats in one instance already share one backend
process, so they do not create separate app-server processes per chat.

Therefore, they do not suffer from the same cross-process dual-live-thread
divergence that exists between Feishu and bare TUI.

### 8.2 Current UX / ownership decision

The current model is no longer the older "one primary notification binding per
`thread_id`" model.

The more accurate description now is:

- one `thread_id` may have multiple Feishu subscribers / bindings at the same
  time
- those subscribers share one backend thread, so this remains backend-safe
- execution-driving and interaction-driving routing still follows explicit
  owner / lease state, not "who bound last"

Concretely:

- Same-instance Feishu / `fcodex` write admission, approvals, user-input requests, and interrupts are controlled by the `interaction owner`
- when a thread has no explicit owner but exactly one Feishu subscriber, the
  runtime may fall back to that sole subscriber for routing; once multiple
  subscribers exist, routing must depend on explicit owner state rather than
  any "last binding wins" guess

The user-visible consequence is:

- non-owner Feishu chats may still keep their binding and observe shared thread facts
- subscribed Feishu chats receive ordinary execution streams, terminal execution cards, and terminal result carriers
- non-owner chats may not write or handle the current turn's approvals / input / interrupt requests
- the system still does not promise a fully mirrored interactive live UI across multiple Feishu chats; approval cards and request-driving interactive events route only to the current `interaction owner`

So the decision at this layer is:

- Feishu allows multiple subscribers on one backend thread
- writability and interactivity are decided by the owner lease
- ordinary replies and terminal output broadcast by subscriber; interactive requests route by owner

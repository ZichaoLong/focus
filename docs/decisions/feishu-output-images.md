## 1. Problem Statement

Users want `feishu-codex` to deliver replies that may contain both text and
images on the Feishu side.

There are two distinct output scenarios:

1. Codex emits an explicit image-generation result as part of a turn.
2. Codex causes some image file to exist locally by some other path, such as a
   shell command, a web fetch, an MCP tool, or manual file creation.

This repository already has a clear terminal text contract, but it does not yet
have a corresponding outbound-image contract.

Without tightening that boundary first, "support image replies" is ambiguous:

- should images live inside the running execution card
- should they be sent as separate Feishu image messages
- should any local image file be auto-sent
- should replay / reconcile after restart re-send them
- should other Feishu bots be expected to consume those outbound images

This document narrows that scope.

## 2. Current Facts

### 2.1 Current Repository Behavior

The current repository baseline is:

1. Feishu-to-Codex image ingress already exists.
   - Feishu `image` attachments are downloaded and staged locally.
   - They are passed into Codex as both path-bearing text context and
     `localImage` turn input.
2. Codex-to-Feishu image egress now splits into two paths:
   - first-class capability: explicit `send-image`
   - upstream-compatible bonus path: `imageGeneration`
3. The current user-visible turn result path is text-only:
   - running output goes to the execution card
   - authoritative terminal text goes to the terminal result card, or falls
     back to plain text
4. `imageGeneration` is no longer the only possible outbound-image path, but it
   remains an upstream-compatible bonus source of images.

So the contract that now needs to stay tight is no longer "whether images are
possible at all", but rather:

- which path is the primary product contract
- which path is only an upstream-compatible bonus
- which state layer each path operates on

### 2.2 Upstream Codex Facts

Upstream Codex already exposes a useful first-class image-generation shape:

- turn items may contain `imageGeneration`
- those items carry:
  - `result`
  - optional `savedPath`
- upstream core tries to save generated image bytes to disk and records
  `savedPath` when that succeeds
- app-server thread snapshots preserve that `savedPath`

Important implications:

1. `result` is currently the upstream image-generation payload and is typically
   base64 image data, but this repository should treat that as an upstream item
   payload rather than inventing its own generic image-decoding contract.
2. `savedPath` is not guaranteed to exist for every `imageGeneration` item.
   Save may fail, or the payload may be invalid.
3. A restart-safe outbound image implementation should not rely only on the
   transient notification stream; it should also be able to recover from
   thread snapshots that still contain `imageGeneration` items with
   `savedPath`.

### 2.3 Feishu Platform Facts

Feishu already supports the primitives needed for a reliable append-only image
delivery path:

- upload an image resource and obtain an `image_key`
- send a message whose `msg_type` is `image`
- reply with an `image` message to a prior message

Official references:

- upload image:
  `https://open.feishu.cn/document/uAjLw4CM/ukTMukTMukTM/reference/im-v1/image/create`
- send message:
  `https://open.feishu.cn/document/uAjLw4CM/ukTMukTMukTM/reference/im-v1/message/create`
- reply message:
  `https://open.feishu.cn/document/uAjLw4CM/ukTMukTMukTM/reference/im-v1/message/reply`

This is a better fit than trying to force outbound images into the current
execution-card patch loop.

## 3. Why Existing Mechanisms Are Not Enough

The current repository already has two strong output layers:

- execution card:
  - human-oriented
  - patchable
  - process-log and staged-reply UI
- terminal result carrier:
  - authoritative text-only result contract
  - stable for Feishu-to-Codex round-trip of `final_reply_text`

Neither of these solves outbound images cleanly:

1. The execution card is currently patch-driven UI, not a general multimedia
   transcript carrier.
2. The authoritative terminal contract is explicitly text-centered today.
3. There is no persisted ledger of "which images for which turn have already
   been delivered to Feishu".
4. There is no current rule for how image outputs should behave under watchdog,
   reconcile, or post-restart recovery.

So image support should not be framed as "just teach the current card to show
images". That would blur the text contract and complicate recovery.

## 4. Decision

The repository should adopt the following outbound-image contract.

### 4.1 Keep Text as the Only Authoritative Round-Trip Contract

`final_reply_text` remains the only authoritative terminal result contract for
Feishu message round-trip and downstream bot consumption.

Images are an additional human-facing artifact. They do not replace
`final_reply_text`, and they are not consumed by the existing strong text
projection contract.

### 4.2 The First-class Capability Is Explicit `send-image`

The primary capability is now explicit `send-image`:

- formal entrypoint: `feishu-codexctl image send --path <file> [--thread-id <id> | --thread-name <name>]`
- if the thread selector is omitted, it may fall back to the `CODEX_THREAD_ID` environment variable
- target scope: all currently `attached` Feishu bindings for the target thread
- transport shape: upload once, then fan out as standalone Feishu `image` messages

This means:

- supported:
  - Codex explicitly deciding that one local image file should be sent to Feishu
  - sending that image from `fcodex`, bare `codex`, or another local entrypoint through one shared control-plane action
- not supported:
  - scanning the workspace and guessing which images should be sent
  - forcing images into the execution-card patch loop

The key distinction is not where the file came from, but whether there is an
explicit outbound action.

### 4.3 `imageGeneration` Remains An Upstream-compatible Bonus Path

Upstream `imageGeneration` items are still worth supporting, but they are no
longer the repository's main contract.

That path depends on:

- whether upstream exposes the tool
- whether auth / provider / model support it
- whether the model actually chooses to call it in that turn

So it is appropriate as a bonus path, not as the repository's only or primary
image capability.

This means:

- supported:
  - images generated by Codex through upstream image-generation capability
- but that path is not the semantic source for "send any local image file"

### 4.4 The `imageGeneration` Path Still Uses `savedPath` As The Canonical Delivery Input

The repository should still treat `savedPath` as the canonical image
delivery input.

Recommended rule:

1. if an `imageGeneration` item has a non-empty `savedPath` and the file still
   exists locally:
   - it is eligible for Feishu delivery
2. if `savedPath` is absent:
   - do not attempt best-effort delivery in phase 1
   - keep the execution-card process note, but do not invent a fallback decode
     path here

This keeps ownership clear:

- upstream owns image-generation payload decoding and saving
- this repository owns Feishu delivery of already-materialized local artifacts

### 4.5 Delivery Shape: Text First, Then 0..N Image Messages

The recommended Feishu delivery order is:

1. continue emitting the current authoritative terminal text carrier
2. then send zero or more Feishu image replies for the same turn

This gives:

- stable text semantics
- simple image transport
- no need to redesign the current execution-card contract

### 4.6 Execution Card Stays Text-Oriented

The execution card may continue to show process notes such as `图片生成`, but it
should not become the authoritative image carrier in phase 1.

Reasons:

- the current execution card is patch-centric
- image delivery is naturally append-only on Feishu
- mixing terminal authoritative text and mutable image UI into one card would
  complicate reconcile, dedupe, and long-running update behavior

### 4.7 The Two Paths Have Different Recovery And Deduplication Boundaries

The `imageGeneration` recovery path must be recovery-safe.

So the implementation should maintain persisted turn-scoped delivery state, for
example keyed by:

- instance
- chat binding
- thread id
- turn id
- image item id

That state must prevent duplicate image delivery across:

- late reconcile
- watchdog recovery
- service restart
- repeated terminal processing of the same turn

Fast path may send an image as soon as an `item/completed(imageGeneration)`
notification arrives with `savedPath`, but that notification stream must not be
the only authority. Recovery should still be able to re-read the terminal thread
snapshot and deliver any missing image artifacts exactly once.

By contrast, explicit `send-image` is a one-shot human / agent control-plane
action:

- no automatic replay
- no automatic reconcile
- no automatic dedupe guarantee
- partial delivery is allowed if later fanout steps fail, but the CLI must
  report that explicitly

## 5. Explicit Non-goals

Phase 1 outbound-image support does not try to solve:

1. generic auto-scan of arbitrary local image files
2. image-gallery patching inside the running execution card
3. making outbound Feishu images part of the existing strong text-ingress
   projection contract
4. guaranteeing that another Feishu bot can reliably consume those image
   messages as machine-readable input

That last point matters because this repository's current Feishu-side bot
triggering and text-ingress model is intentionally text-centered and does not
define a second strong contract for bot-authored image replies.

## 6. Implications for the Two Common User Expectations

### 6.1 "Codex generated an image"

This should be supported as a bonus path, but only through explicit upstream
`imageGeneration` items with a usable `savedPath`.

### 6.2 "Codex downloaded or created an image file locally"

This is now first-class supported, but not because a local image file merely
exists. It is supported only when:

- Codex or the operator explicitly executes `send-image`

In other words, the repository supports "explicitly send this image", not
"automatically discover and send this image".

Auto-sending arbitrary local image files remains ambiguous and unsafe.

## 7. Current Conclusion And Follow-up Recommendation

The formal direction is now:

1. keep the existing text result contract unchanged
2. make explicit `send-image` the first-class image capability
3. keep `imageGeneration` as an upstream-compatible bonus path
4. only deliver `imageGeneration` results that have `savedPath`, with per-turn dedupe / recovery state
5. keep explicit `send-image` thread-scoped, fail-closed, and shaped as standalone image-message fanout

The repository now also includes one thin skill example:

- `.agents/skills/feishu-send-image/`

`feishu-codex skill install` installs the current managed skill set into the
current directory's `.agents/skills/`, including:

- `feishu-send-image`
- `feishu-scheduled-prompts`

That makes it directory-scoped:

- run it in `~` if you want home-level Codex threads to discover it
- run it in a repository if you want it to apply only to that repository

It only tells Codex to call:

- `feishu-codexctl image send --path ...`

rather than moving core image-delivery logic into the skill layer.

It is still worth observing upstream `imageGeneration` / `savedPath` / backend-auth stability, but that path should not be promoted into the repository's primary contract.
